Congratulations on your first submission Noriko!

Good job with your visual design for this submission! Your site matches the mockup fairly closely with

some small discrepancies. Nice going with your folder structure! Great application of semantic HTML tags

throughout your site! You could consider including <address>, as well as nesting your product cards

inside of <article>. Avoid the use of id selectors, for example #promotion and #promotion-title (line 51:

index), we want to ensure our css is as reuseable as possible, you could opt for p .promotion {} in order to

achieve good specificity - you can then reuse that promotion class where and as needed. Very fun

addition of animations on the social media icons - NICE! Use "margin: 0 auto;" to keep your elements

centered (in particular your p tags on menu.html which do not currently stay centred when the screen size

changes. Try to nest your products into a container (index.html) - that will now allow you to use flex on

this items.Great job manipulating the display property consistently to create your HTML layout as well as

understanding and applying the box model! Run your HTML through https://validator.w3.org to check for

any errors in your markup.

This is a great start with a lot of potential. We look forward to the next submission!
